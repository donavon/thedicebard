# Your First Session: A Simple Session Zero Guide

Session Zero is a short, low-pressure meeting where everyone gets on the same
page before the adventure begins. It makes the first play session smoother and
more fun.

## 1. Decide the tone

Is this a lighthearted adventure, a heroic epic, or a spooky mystery? A shared
tone helps everyone make characters that fit the same story.

## 2. Agree on table rules

Keep it simple:

- Be kind and supportive
- Share the spotlight
- Ask questions when unsure

## 3. Build characters together

When players make characters at the same time, it is easier to connect them.
Maybe two characters are siblings, or they are friends from the same town.

## 4. Set boundaries

If certain topics are not fun for your group, say so upfront. A safe table means
more trust and better roleplay.

## 5. Explain the basic loop

Tell new players:

1. The DM describes the scene.
2. Players say what they want to do.
3. Dice decide if it works.

## 6. End with a quick teaser

Give them a hook: a map, a rumor, or a first quest. It builds excitement for
Session One.

Session Zero does not need to be long. Even 20–30 minutes makes a huge
difference.
