# How to Create Your First D&D Character

Building a character should feel exciting, not overwhelming. Here is a simple
path that helps you get playing quickly while still giving you room to roleplay
and make choices.

## 1. Pick a concept you can explain in one sentence

Examples: "Brave young ranger who loves animals" or "Curious wizard who keeps a
notebook of spells." This keeps your choices focused.

## 2. Choose a class that matches your concept

Class is what your character does best.

- **Fighter**: sturdy and straightforward
- **Rogue**: sneaky and clever
- **Wizard**: powerful spells and big ideas
- **Cleric**: helpful magic and support

If you are unsure, pick the class that sounds the most fun.

## 3. Choose a species (race)

Pick a species for flavor. It gives you a few bonuses, but the real benefit is
roleplay. Think about how your character grew up and what they value.

## 4. Decide on a background

Backgrounds explain your character’s history. Examples include: student,
folk hero, sailor, or entertainer. This helps with roleplay and gives a few
extra skills.

## 5. Assign ability scores

Most beginners use the standard array from the Player’s Handbook. Put your
highest scores in the abilities your class uses most. A fighter wants Strength,
a wizard wants Intelligence, and so on.

## 6. Pick a few personality details

Add two quick details:

- **Motivation**: What does your character want?
- **Quirk**: What is something odd or charming about them?

These make it easier to speak and act in character.

## 7. Choose simple starting gear

Most classes include a short list of starting equipment. Pick the option that
fits your concept and move on.

## 8. Give them a name

It can be serious or playful. The only rule is that you like it.

## Quick checklist

- I can describe my character in one sentence
- I know my class and background
- I have a reason to join the adventure

That is it. Your first character does not need to be perfect. D&D characters
grow and change as the story unfolds.
