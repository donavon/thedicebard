# Dice, Checks, and Saving Throws: A Beginner’s Guide

D&D looks complicated until you learn the simple pattern:

**Roll a d20 + add a number + compare to a target.**

## The d20 and modifiers

Most of the time you roll a **d20**. The number you add is called a
**modifier**, and it comes from an ability score or a skill.

Example: If you are good at Athletics, you might add +3 to climb a wall.

## Ability checks

Use an **ability check** when a character tries something risky or uncertain,
like sneaking past guards or persuading a shopkeeper.

- The Dungeon Master (DM) sets a **Difficulty Class (DC)**.
- If your roll + modifier is equal to or higher than the DC, you succeed.

## Saving throws

Saving throws happen when something bad is happening to you, like a trap or a
spell. The rules are the same as a check, but the DM asks for a saving throw
instead.

## Advantage and disadvantage

If you have **advantage**, roll two d20s and take the higher one. If you have
**disadvantage**, roll two d20s and take the lower one.

This keeps the game fast and adds excitement without extra math.

## A simple example

You try to leap across a gap.

- The DM sets the DC at 12.
- You roll a 9 and add +4 Athletics.
- 9 + 4 = 13. You make the jump.

## Remember this

When you feel stuck, just ask: **What am I rolling? What am I adding?** The rest
falls into place quickly.
