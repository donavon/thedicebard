## Frequently Asked Quests (FAQ)

<FaqItem question="What exactly is Dungeons &amp; Dragons?">
  Think of it as a **collaborative campfire story** where your kids are the main
  characters. As the Dungeon Master (DM), I describe the world and the monsters;
  the players decide what to do next. We use dice to see if their daring plans
  succeed. It is heavy on imagination, light on screen time, and great for
  teamwork.

<FaqItem question='What kind of "loot" do we need to provide?'>
  Honestly? Just a surface! A **dining room table, kitchen island, or even an
  outdoor picnic table** works perfectly. I bring the "Hoard": dice, character
  sheets, maps, and miniatures. No expensive manuals or dragon-slaying gear
  required on your end.

<FaqItem question="Is D&amp;D appropriate for 10 to 13-year-olds?">
  Absolutely. At this age, the game is a fantastic outlet for creativity and
  problem-solving. My sessions are "PG-Rated" adventures - think *The Hobbit* or
  *Stranger Things* (minus the scary bits). It is about being a hero, helping
  friends, and occasionally rolling a 1 and falling into a bush.

<FaqItem question="How many players can join the party?">
  For the best experience, I recommend a party of **5 or 6 players**. This
  ensures everyone gets plenty of "spotlight time" to be the hero without the
  game slowing down.
</FaqItem>

<FaqItem question="Does it have to be a one-time thing?">
  Not at all! While I love a good birthday "One-Shot" (a self-contained story),
  I also run **ongoing campaigns**. If the kids catch the D&amp;D bug, I can
  come back weekly or monthly to continue their epic saga where they left off.

<FaqItem question="D&amp;D for a birthday party?">
  When kids are little, parties are all about bouncy houses and magicians. As
  they get a bit older, they want something more immersive and memorable. A
  D&amp;D birthday is the perfect upgrade: it keeps everyone engaged, gives each
  kid a moment to shine, and turns the celebration into a story they will talk
  about long after the cake is gone.

<FaqItem question="What if my child has never played before?">
  Perfect! Most of my players are "Level 1" in real life. I spend the first few
  minutes teaching the basics in a way that is easy to grasp. By the 20-minute
  mark, they will be casting spells and dodging traps like pros.

<FaqItem question="Where do you offer your D&amp;D party experience?">
  We serve families across **New Jersey’s Essex and Passaic County**, including
  **Montclair, Glen Ridge, Bloomfield, Nutley, Verona, Cedar Grove, and
  Clifton**, plus nearby towns.
